## Overview 

We want to create a web portal that facilitates the civic engagement around how to rebuild Lahaina, Maui, including surveys, forums, sharing design concepts with visual and data models for economic, environmental, etc. analysis.

## Outline

- Survey
- Forum
- Data Analytics and Visualization
- Generative AI (Image AI)
- GIS and Mapping Features


## Implementation 

1. Mapping software (GIS)
2. 3d Modeling tools, art sketching for 2d concepts (AI image/model
   generation for prototyping buildings, landscape)
3. Data Science tools (incl AI analysis and dashboard creation), tables,
   charts, graphics, CoLab, Jupyter
4. Community Engagement (discussion forums linked to models, surveys,
   https://pol.is, http://www.hierr.online )
5. Economic and Environmental Simulation/Analysis Tools
6. Online and in-person shared digital spaces (e.g. UHâ€™s Sage3)

## Basic Flow
1. Users enter website (or in-person room) to view model
2. User engages with Surveys, adding to sentiment, values,
3. User explores virtual Lahaina and data dashboard functions
4. User provides feedback comments, engages with discussions
5. Community immersive events to share scenarios
6. Lahaina economy and housing reopens before 2030
